You push to the branch Vercel is watching (usually main):

git push


# what is a website fundamentally for?

Home → Hook. “WTF is this? Oh, cool.” → click.

Features → Product. “What can these AI employees do and how?”

Enterprise → Scale & safety. “Can we run this at org level?”

Pricing → Money. “Can I afford this and what do I get?”

Resources → Depth. “Show me docs, changelog, blog, guides.”

Dojo → Belief. “What’s the bigger vision / cult / philosophy?”

## home page
1. Home – The hook & first filter

Purpose:

Turn a complete stranger into someone who gets the idea and wants to click one thing.

Home should:

Say what Xemployee is in 1–2 sentences
→ “AI employees that take over entire roles.”

Show a few concrete things it can do now
→ your “forms, outbound, support” bullets

Push one main action
→ “Launch your first Xemployee” (install / waitlist / talk to you)

What doesn’t belong here:

Deep technical details

Long security / compliance lists

Full feature matrix

Pricing tables

Long manifesto

Home = elevator pitch + first “hell yes” click.

## feature page
2. Features – “What makes this a real employee?”

Purpose:

Explain how Xemployee works and what it can actually do day-to-day.

Features should answer:

What makes an AI employee different from a chatbot or basic agent?

What are the capabilities: senses (access), actions, loops, SOPs, guardrails?

What are the main roles I can use today? (outbound, forms, support, etc.)

How can I create my own Xemployee vs use pre-built ones?

Think of Features as:

“If Home convinced you this is exciting, Features convinces you this is real and thought-through.”

What doesn’t belong here:

Pricing

Long-term sci-fi lore

Big enterprise logo wall / security certification stuff (put that on Enterprise)


## enterpise page

3. Enterprise – “Can this run inside my company safely?”

Purpose:

Convince serious teams / bigger companies that Xemployee can be used at org scale.

Enterprise should answer:

How do we standardize on Xemployee across a team/org?

What controls does leadership get? (God mode, permissions, audit logs)

What about security, compliance, data, SSO?

Is there support / onboarding / “launch partner” program?

This is where your Impenetrable Fortress, Overlord Dashboard, God Mode, etc. live – but grounded.

What doesn’t belong here:

Basic “What is an AI employee?” explanations

Individual feature details for solo users

Pricing numbers (link them to Pricing instead)

Enterprise = “we’re not just a toy for hackers; this can be your company’s new default.”

## pricing page

4. Pricing – “How much does this cost?”

Purpose:

Convince serious teams / bigger companies that Xemployee can be used at org scale.

Enterprise should answer:

How do we standardize on Xemployee across a team/org?

What controls does leadership get? (God mode, permissions, audit logs)

What about security, compliance, data, SSO?

Is there support / onboarding / “launch partner” program?

This is where your Impenetrable Fortress, Overlord Dashboard, God Mode, etc. live – but grounded.

What doesn’t belong here:

Basic “What is an AI employee?” explanations

Individual feature details for solo users

Pricing numbers (link them to Pricing instead)

Enterprise = “we’re not just a toy for hackers; this can be your company’s new default.”

## resources
5. Resources – “Show me more detail / proof / how-tos”

Purpose:

Be the library: docs, changelog, blog, tutorials, guides, case studies.

Resources should group:

Docs (when you have them)

Changelog (what’s shipping, proof you’re alive)

Blog (essays, economics of AI employees, use-cases)

Guides / Tutorials (e.g. “How to run your first outbound Xemployee”)

Links to Discord, GitHub, community etc.

This is where someone who’s already interested goes to deepen their understanding or implement.

What doesn’t belong here:

Top-level positioning / headline stuff

Raw pricing

Enterprise security wall
